# HotPi - A Pi Zero W Reflow Oven Controller

## What is it ?
Years ago I bought a small oven for reflow conversion but never really got
around to it.  More recently I've had a need to reflow boards more accurately
than I can do 'by eye' so I decided to make some time and throw something
together using mainly bits I have to hand.

A &pound;9 Pi Zero W, an old project box that's probably older than I am, some
jellybean parts lying in my junk box, some nice 480V 25A SSRs I bought at the
same time as the oven, coupled with a few other cheap bits and pieces like an
open frame Mean Well IRM-10-5 5V 2A flyback converter should suffice.  Nothing
fancy, no bells and whistles.

The PCB is intended to be milled as it should be a quicker turnaround and
cheaper since I have the copper clad and engraving bits already, although it
is much more labour intensive than outsourcing to China.

This is a personal one-off project and not intended for anybody else's
consumption.  But in case somebody's tempted then the usual disclaimers about
playing with mains voltages apply...
